# deepnect

### Work In Progress ###

Uses libfreenect & TinyEXR (QT for optional image saving with QImage).

Builds on the opengl cpp wrapper example from libfreenect!

* Save RGB Point Clouds in a .PLY file from the kinect
* Save RGB image sequences
* Save OpenEXR RGB files with depth included as a ZDepth channel
* Preview in 3D

Why's this useful?

* Record point cloud video!
* Relight footage you've shot!
* Automatically generate dummy geo for VFX!
* Always have 3D reference of a scene!
* No more rotoscoping!
* With some work - create a 3D 'visible model' of the scene from only recorded video
