# deepnect

### Work In Progress ###

Uses libfreenect, TinyEXR and QT (Optional image saving with QImage).

Builds on the opengl cpp wrapper example from libfreenect!

* Save RGB Point Clouds in a .PLY file from the kinect
* Save RGB image sequences
* Save OpenEXR RGB files with depth included as a ZDepth channel

Why's this useful?

* Record point cloud video!
* Relight footage you've shot
* Automatically generate dummy geo for VFX
* No more rotoscoping!
* With some work - create a 3D model of the scene from only recorded video
